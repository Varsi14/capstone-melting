The Python scripts in the RDF folder can be used to simulate the interaction of the atoms in an a x b x c supercell. The mdrun.py simulates the trajectory of the atoms. While running the code, it will ask to enter the supercell size (a x b x c), the element and the temperatures. The temperature can be enter manually (m) or a range (r) and number of temperature be chosen. The mdplot.py transforms the trajectory to a radial distribution function plots it for every temperature seperatly. It also combines every plots and displace in 2D, 3D and contour.
